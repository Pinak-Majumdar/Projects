PROJECT

Market Entry Analysis for ABG Motors (India)



Overview



This project is a capstone case study completed as part of a Data Science with AI certification program. The objective is to assist a hypothetical automotive company, ABG Motors, in evaluating whether entering the Indian market would be profitable by analyzing customer data from Japan and India.



The project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow, including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and business interpretation, supported by data visualization.



Business Problem



ABG Motors is a successful Japanese automobile manufacturer considering expansion into the Indian market. The company believes that customer behavior in India may be similar to Japan and wants to validate this assumption before entering the market.



The goal is to:



Build a predictive model using Japanese customer data



Apply the learned patterns to Indian customer data



Estimate potential customer demand in India



Support the decision using data-driven insights and visualizations



Datasets



The project uses the following datasets:



Japanese customer dataset used for model training



Indian customer dataset used for prediction and market estimation



The datasets contain demographic and behavioral attributes relevant to customer purchase decisions.



Methodology



The following steps were performed in the project:



Data cleaning and preprocessing



Feature engineering, including calculation of derived variables



Training a classification model on the Japanese dataset



Evaluating model performance using standard metrics



Applying the trained model to Indian data to estimate potential customers



Visualizing trends and predictions using Tableau dashboards



Tools and Technologies Used



Python



Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation



Machine learning libraries for model building and evaluation



Microsoft Excel for initial data handling



Tableau for data visualization and dashboard creation



Results and Insights



A baseline predictive model was successfully built using Japanese market data



The model was applied to Indian data to estimate potential buyers



Visual analysis helped compare customer trends across both markets



The results provided insights into the feasibility of market entry based on projected demand
